# Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Description
This project demonstrates image compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) implemented in MATLAB. It includes both a standalone script and a MATLAB app for interactive compression.

## Features
- Standalone MATLAB script for image compression using SVD.
- MATLAB app with a user-friendly interface for selecting files and adjusting compression level.
- Slider interface for selecting the number of singular values to use in compression.
- Splits the image into RGB channels for visualization and comparison before and after compression.
- Saves the compressed image in the same directory as the original image.

## Usage
### Standalone Script
1. Run `image_compression_script.m`.
2. Select the image file you want to compress when prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to enter the desired number of singular values for compression.
4. The compressed image and its RGB channels will be saved in the same directory.

### MATLAB App
1. Run `image_compression_app.mlapp`.
2. Click on the "Browse" button to select the image file you want to compress.
3. Use the slider to adjust the compression level by selecting the number of singular values.
4. Click on the "Compress Image" button to start the compression process.
5. The compressed image and its RGB channels will be saved in the same directory.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018a or later.
